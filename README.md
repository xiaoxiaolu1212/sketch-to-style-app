## Technical Details

### Current Implementation
This is a **frontend prototype** that demonstrates the user interface and user experience. The actual AI transformation is currently simulated with mock results.

### Future Enhancements
To make this a fully functional application, you would need to:

1. **Integrate AI APIs**: Connect to services like:
   - OpenAI's DALL-E API
   - Stability AI's API
   - Google's Imagen API
   - Custom trained models

2. **Backend Development**: Create a server to handle:
   - File uploads
   - API calls to AI services
   - Image processing
   - User authentication (optional)

3. **Database Integration**: Store user uploads and results (optional)
